This project is a bundle of the FrameScript video editor & motion graphics tool and its project.
The files the user should mainly edit are in the `project/` directory and `project/project.tsx`, while the FrameScript core and libraries are in `src/`.
Please read the code under `src/` carefully and comprehensively.
As a rule, it is preferable not to edit code under `src/` except for contributing to FrameScript. (If the user explicitly wants edits, follow that.)
